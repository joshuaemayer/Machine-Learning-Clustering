# Machine Learning - Clustering

# Background

In this project we look at something that's relatively simple but fundamental to just about any business: Customer Segmentation. At the core of customer segmentation is being able to identify different types of customers and then figure out ways to find more of those individuals so you can... you guessed it, get more customers! In this project, I'll detail how you can use K-Means clustering to help with some of the exploratory aspects of customer segmentation.

# Data

The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. The data is presented as an Excel workbook containing two worksheets. Each worksheet contains a different dataset.

# Conclusion

Basic concepts learned include: K-Means Clustering, The Elboy Sum-of-Squares Method, The Silhouette Method, Looping over variables to choose appropriate values of K, Visualizing Clusters using PCA, and explorting other clustering algorithms (e.g. Affinity Propagation).
